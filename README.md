# Hospital_Management_Dashboard

🏥 Hospital Data Analysis | Power BI Dashboard

I recently developed a Hospital Management Dashboard using Power BI to analyze patient records, treatment details, doctor performance, and hospital revenue trends.


🔍 Key Highlights:

Designed interactive dashboards with KPIs (total patients, admissions, revenue, occupancy rate).

Analyzed department-wise performance, patient demographics, and treatment costs.

Identified patterns in patient inflow, bed utilization, and doctor efficiency.

Derived insights to improve hospital resource allocation and enhance patient care.

📊 Tools Used: Power BI | DAX | Power Query | Excel/MySQL

This project helped me strengthen my skills in data visualization, performance monitoring, and healthcare analytics.
